About:
This is a front-end web application for my sister's small business, Sip 'N' Soak. Unfortunately, I was unable to make progress on the back-end development I had planned due to being sick for over a week. However, I am pleased with the progress Iâ€™ve made and the lessons learned during the front-end development process.

How to Run the Web Application:

Step 1. Open up a new terminal and navigate to the project folder using this comand `cd /path/to/sns-app`
Step 2. Use `npm install` command in your terminal and return. This will install all dependencies/packages listed in the package.json file.
Step 3. Use `npm ls` command to check all depencencies are installed/listed.
Step 4. Start the development server with command `npm run dev`.

Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your system. If not, download and install them from Node.js Official Website.
For any issues, double-check the installed packages or refer to the error messages in the terminal.

Major Packages Installed:

React & React DOM: Core libraries for building React applications.
Material-UI (MUI): For UI components and icons.
FontAwesome: For scalable vector icons and social logos.
React Router DOM: For client-side routing.
Framer Motion: For animations.
Vite: A build tool for development and production.
Development Tools:

ESLint and Plugins: Tools for linting JavaScript and React code.
@types/...: TypeScript support for React.

New things learnt/used during this project:

MUI or Material UI another library similar to bootstrap but works with React.JS rather than CSS

New react Hooks: `useContext` hook. This hook allows me to share the state or values of elements globaly accross a component tree instead of "prop-drilling" making the code more simple and functional. You can access the context values directly when components are wrapped in the <Context.Provider> using the `useContext` hook.

Also use useEffect hook which i found can be a really good tool especially for styling

Takeaways

CSS Structure:
For future projects, I aim to structure CSS files more effectively to ensure styles are scoped properly, avoiding unintended global application. This was a challenge in this project, leading to some messy code with too many classes on elements.

Code Optimization:
I am gradually learning to:
Shorten code wherever possible.
Make code easier to read and maintain.
Use tools and libraries in innovative ways.
Create reusable components to streamline development and maintain consistency.
